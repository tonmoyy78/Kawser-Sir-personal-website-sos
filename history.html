            <h2>Early History</h2>
            <p>Little is known about W. Sahara until the 4th century BC, when trade with Europe began. During the middle ages it was occupied first by Berbers and then by the Arabic speaking Muslim Bedouins. Portuguese navigators reached Cape Bojdor on the northern coast of present day W. Sahara in 1434. However, there was little European contact with the region until the 19th century.</p>
            <p>In the 19th century the Spanish laid claim to the southern coastal region, called Rio de Oro, and later occupied the northern interior region, Saguia el Hamra in 1934. The Spanish formally united the two regions, and it became known as Spanish Sahara in 1958. Both Morocco and Mauritania sought to control the territory and when the Spanish departed in 1976, they divided the territory between them.</p>
            <p>In the meantime the indigenous Saharawis began fighting for independence. In 1976 the insurgents called the Polisario front, declared a government-in-exile (the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic) from their base in Algeria. Mauritania reached a peace agreement with the Polisario in 1979, but Morocco then seized the land given up by Mauritania and now exerts administrative control over the entire region. The Frente Polisario fought Morocco to a stalemate and agreed in Sept 1991 to a cease fire, which was contingent on a referendum regarding independence.</p>
