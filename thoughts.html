            <h2>G6's Laws for MINURSO UNMOs</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>When computing, whatever happens, behave as though you meant it to happen.</li>
                <li>When you get to the point where you really understand your computer, it's probably obsolete.</li>
                <li>The first place to look for information is in the section of the manual where you would least expect to find it.</li>
                <li>When the going gets tough, UPGRADE.</li>
                <li>For every action there is an equal and opposite malfunction.</li>
                <li>To err is human... to blame your computer for your mistakes is even more human, it's downright natural.</li>
                <li>He who laughs last, probably has a backup.</li>
                <li>The number one cause of computer problem is computer solutions.</li>
                <li>A complex system that doesn't work is invariably found to have evolved from a simpler system that worked just fine.</li>
                <li>A computer program will always do what you tell it to do, but rarely what u want it to do.</li>
